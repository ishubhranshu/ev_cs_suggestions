# ev_cs_suggestions
•	Our algorithm ranks charging stations based on energy gain to energy spent ratio, user direction, previous visits, and overall user feedback.
•	The algorithm suggests stations that minimize distance, cost, and align with the user's current direction to improve convenience and reduce the energy consumption.
•	Developed a novel approach to categorise preferable and non-preferable stations.
•	The algorithm uses past user visits and feedback for personalized station suggestions.
